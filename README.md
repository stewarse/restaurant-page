# restaurant-page

In this lesson I'll work on building experience with webpack and npm in order
to get used to bundling different scripts together to dynamically generate
webpages.

Goals:

- Build experience with:
  ~ webpack incl webpack config
  ~ package.json files
  ~ separating pages into diff modules & dynamically loading html through js
  ~ hosting a bundled site on github so it can be accessed
